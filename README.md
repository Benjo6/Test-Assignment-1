# Test-Assignment-1


##1. REFLECTIONS

### Shooting

**A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.**

The possible reasons for the man not dying:
 Missed shot
 No more bullet
 Damaged ammo
 Wear a bulletproof vest
 Timely first aid
 Avoid
 Fake gun
 Shot without hitting a dangerous place
 Someone took the bullets
 Can dodge
 Imagination
 Filming
 
 ### Alien
 **An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)**
 
1. Grasp the toothpaste tube with your left hand and turn the cap counterclockwise with your right hand until the cap comes off.

2. With your right hand, take the toothbrush and raise it so that the bristles face upward.

3. Squeeze a generous amount of paste over the toothbrush's bristles after thoroughly removing the cap.

4. Wet the toothpaste (or dont, however you prefer)

5. With your mouth open, place the toothbrush there.
Reaching your mouth, place the bristles there and massage them in a circular motion over your teeth.

6. Continue until all of your teeth are spotlessly clean. 

## 2. Two Katas

TDD is under the unittest class where I first created the tests and then proceed to get the class and methods. There is two classes within this project which is RomanNumeralKataTests and TemperatureKataTests.

BDD is under the SpecFlowBDD project, where there are features and stepdefinitions. Features are all the scenarios I want to test, while stepdefinitions are the generated based on these scenarios. The created stepdefinitions are a collection of methods where I input the right code into these methods.

## 3. Give your thoughts on BDD

**What was positive and good about using BDD?*

BDD usage of plain text to create scenarios, which then turns into methods is pretty awesome. BDD frameworks make it easy to turn scenarios into automated tests. BDD scenarios are easy to update as the project changes.

**What was annoying or difficult**

Gherkin's logic was challenging to understand for the beginning. There was a ton of new rules you have to take into account and formulation was by far the most challenging aspect of it.

**What surprised you?**

The importance of formulation. I was really surprised how important the formulation in Gherkin. You have to be extremely precise and understand how to use the right keywords to get the desired results. The tests will easily fail, if they are vaguely described. Precision is KEY.

**Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more**

??

**Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?**

The only test that I didn't think of myself was testing the exception.

## 1. REFLECTIONS

### Shooting

**A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.**

The possible reasons for the man not dying:
 
 -Missed shot
 
 -No more bullet
 
 -Damaged ammo
 
 -Wear a bulletproof vest
 
 -Timely first aid
 
 -Avoid
 
 -Fake gun
 
 -Shot without hitting a dangerous place
 
 -Someone took the bullets
 
 -Can dodge
 
 -Imagination
 
 -Filming
 
 ### Alien
 **An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)**
 
1. Grasp the toothpaste tube with your left hand and turn the cap counterclockwise with your right hand until the cap comes off.

2. With your right hand, take the toothbrush and raise it so that the bristles face upward.

3. Squeeze a generous amount of paste over the toothbrush's bristles after thoroughly removing the cap.

4. Wet the toothpaste (or dont, however you prefer)

5. With your mouth open, place the toothbrush there.
Reaching your mouth, place the bristles there and massage them in a circular motion over your teeth.

6. Continue until all of your teeth are spotlessly clean. 

## 2. Two Katas

The unit test class is where TDD is located, and I initially developed the tests before developing the classes and methods. This project consists of two classes. 

[RomanNumeralKataTests.cs](https://github.com/Benjo6/Test-Assignment-1/blob/master/UnitTest/RomanNumeralKataTests.cs) 

[TemperatureKataTests.cs](https://github.com/Benjo6/Test-Assignment-1/blob/master/UnitTest/RomanNumeralKataTests.cs)

The SpecFlowBDD project, which contains features and stepdefinitions, is where BDD is located. The scenarios I want to test are all the features, and stepdefinitions are created based on these scenarios. I inserted the appropriate code into the several methods that make up the stepdefinitions that I developed. 

## 3. Give your thoughts on BDD

**What was positive and good about using BDD?**

It's quite fantastic how BDD uses plain text to construct scenarios that become test methods. Scenarios can easily be converted into automated tests using BDD frameworks. BDD scenarios are straightforward to update as the project changes. 

**What was annoying or difficult**

Gherkin's logic was initially difficult to grasp. The formulation was by far the most tricky aspect of it because there were so many new rules to contemplate. 

**What surprised you?**

The importance of formulation. I was really surprised how important the formulation in Gherkin. To achieve the desired outcomes, you must be very exact and know how to employ the appropriate keywords. If the tests are poorly stated, they will easily fail.The key is PRECISION. 

**Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more**

I did gain a better knowledge of what my code is exactly doing and how its executed.

**Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?**

The exception test was the only one I failed to think of myself.
